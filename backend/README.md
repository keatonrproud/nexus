# Google OneTap Integration - Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **OneTap Error on Localhost**:

   - Added proper error handling for localhost domains
   - Implemented fallback to traditional OAuth flow when OneTap fails
   - Added intelligent detection of localhost environment

2. **Double Authentication Flow**:
   - Fixed the flow so OneTap credential is processed directly without redirect
   - Updated auth context to handle both OneTap JWT tokens and traditional OAuth
   - Prevented duplicate authentication requests

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

1. **GoogleSignInButton.tsx**:

   - Added better error handling for OneTap
   - Added fallback mechanism for localhost environments
   - Improved button click handling to prevent duplicate auth flows

2. **Auth Hook and Context**:

   - Updated `useAuth` hook to handle both credential and redirect flows
   - Enhanced `login` function to accept optional credential parameter
   - Fixed type definitions across the auth context

3. **LoginPage Component**:
   - Updated to correctly pass credentials to the auth context
   - Fixed credential handling to prevent double authentication

### Backend Changes

1. **Auth Controller**:

   - Added dedicated OneTap callback endpoint
   - Implemented JWT token verification for Google credentials
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing OAuth flow

2. **Auth Routes**:
   - Added new POST endpoint for OneTap callback
   - Added validation middleware for credential parameter

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. Run the application locally
2. Try both the normal Google Sign-In button
3. Verify no double authentication occurs
4. Verify the OneTap flow works on non-localhost domains
