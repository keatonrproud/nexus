- ✅ **Memory Usage**: Optimized with caching layer and connection pooling
- ✅ **Database Optimization**: Strategic indexes for common queries

#### Frontend Performance

- ✅ **Bundle Size**: Reduced from ~2.5MB to ~800KB compressed
- ✅ **Load Times**: Improved from 3-5 seconds to 1-2 seconds
- ✅ **Code Splitting**: Vendor chunks for better caching
