# Analytics Integration

This project uses **GoatCounter** for web analytics, providing privacy-focused, lightweight analytics without the limitations of other solutions.

## Features

- **Privacy-focused**: No cookies, no tracking across sites
- **Lightweight**: Minimal impact on page load times
- **No site limits** (unlike other analytics platforms)
- **Open source**: Self-hostable or use the cloud service
- **Simple API**: Easy integration with applications
- **Real-time data**: Live visitor tracking
- **Comprehensive data**: Browsers, systems, locations, referrals, and more
- **Detailed analytics dashboard**: Interactive charts and breakdowns
- **Multiple visualization types**: Bar charts, doughnut charts, line graphs
- **Per-project configuration**: Each project can have its own GoatCounter site and API token

## Why GoatCounter?

- **No site limits**
- **Privacy-focused** and GDPR compliant
- **Lightweight** (~2KB tracking script)
- **Self-hosted or cloud** options available
- **Simple API** with good documentation
- **Rich analytics data** with detailed breakdowns

## Configuration

### Per-Project Configuration

Each project stores its own GoatCounter site code and API token in the database:

```sql
-- Projects table includes both site code and API token
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN goatcounter_site_code VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN goatcounter_api_token VARCHAR(500);
```

**Benefits of per-project tokens:**

- Each project can use a different GoatCounter account
- Better security isolation between projects
- Easier to manage permissions per project
- No global configuration required

## Migration from Global Token

If you're upgrading from a previous version that used a global `GOATCOUNTER_API_TOKEN`, follow these steps:

### 1. Database Migration

Run this SQL command in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS goatcounter_api_token VARCHAR(500);
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables

Remove the global token from your `.env` file:

```bash
# Remove this line:
# GOATCOUNTER_API_TOKEN=your-global-token
```

### 3. Configure Projects

For each project that needs analytics:

1. Edit the project in the UI
2. Add the GoatCounter site code
3. Add the corresponding API token
4. Save the project

### 4. Verify Analytics

Check that analytics data appears correctly in the dashboard for each configured project.

## API Structure

GoatCounter uses a site-specific API structure:

- **API Base URL**: `https://{site_code}.goatcounter.com/api/v0`
- **Authentication**: `Authorization: Bearer {api_token}`
- **Rate Limit**: 4 requests per second

## Implementation

### GoatCounterClient

The `GoatCounterClient` class handles all API interactions using the official GoatCounter API endpoints. Each method now accepts both the site code and API token as parameters:

```typescript
import { goatcounterClient } from "../config/analytics";

// Get detailed hits data
const hits = await goatcounterClient.getHits(
  "your-site-code",
  "your-api-token",
  "2024-01-01",
  "2024-01-31",
  { daily: true, limit: 50 },
);

// Get total counts
const totals = await goatcounterClient.getTotalCount(
  "your-site-code",
  "your-api-token",
  "2024-01-01",
  "2024-01-31",
);

// Get browser statistics
const browsers = await goatcounterClient.getStatsPage(
  "your-site-code",
  "your-api-token",
  "browsers",
  "2024-01-01",
  "2024-01-31",
);

// Get all paths on the site
const paths = await goatcounterClient.getPaths(
  "your-site-code",
  "your-api-token",
);

// Get referrals for a specific path
const referrals = await goatcounterClient.getPathReferrals(
  "your-site-code",
  "your-api-token",
  123, // path ID
  "2024-01-01",
  "2024-01-31",
);

// Track pageview (server-side)
await goatcounterClient.trackPageview(
  "your-site-code",
  "your-api-token",
  "/page-path",
  "Page Title",
  "https://referrer.com",
);
```

## Setup Guide

### 1. Create GoatCounter Account

- Sign up at [goatcounter.com](https://goatcounter.com)
- Create a site for each project you want to track
- Note the site code (e.g., `myproject` from `myproject.goatcounter.com`)

### 2. Get API Token for Each Site

- Go to Settings â†’ API in your GoatCounter dashboard
- Create a new API token for each site
- Copy the API token (you'll need this for each project)

### 3. Configure Projects

- When creating or editing a project in the Bug/Idea Board:
  - Add the GoatCounter site code (e.g., "myproject")
  - Add the corresponding API token
- Both fields are optional, but both are required for analytics to work

### 4. Add Tracking Script (Frontend)

Add to each project's HTML (replace YOURCODE with your site code):

```html
<script
  data-goatcounter="https://YOURCODE.goatcounter.com/count"
  async
  src="//gc.zgo.at/count.js"
></script>
```

### 5. Verify Setup

- Create some test pageviews on your site
- Check the analytics dashboard in the Bug/Idea Board
- Data should appear within a few minutes

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Analytics Service

```typescript
import { analyticsApi } from "@/services/analyticsService";

// Get detailed browser statistics
const browserStats = await analyticsApi.getDetailedAnalytics(
  "project-id",
  "browsers",
  "2024-01-01",
  "2024-01-31",
  { limit: 10 },
);

// Get all paths for a project
const paths = await analyticsApi.getProjectPaths("project-id", { limit: 50 });

// Get referrals for a specific path
const referrals = await analyticsApi.getPathReferrals(
  "project-id",
  123, // path ID
  "2024-01-01",
  "2024-01-31",
);

// Get total counts
const totals = await analyticsApi.getTotalCounts(
  "project-id",
  "2024-01-01",
  "2024-01-31",
);

// Get detailed hits data
const hits = await analyticsApi.getHitsData(
  "project-id",
  "2024-01-01",
  "2024-01-31",
  { daily: true, limit: 20 },
);

// Get user's GoatCounter sites
const userSites = await analyticsApi.getUserSites();
```

## Error Handling

The client includes comprehensive error handling:

- **API errors**: Logged and re-thrown with descriptive messages
- **Tracking failures**: Logged but don't break the main application flow
- **Missing configuration**: Clear error messages for setup issues
- **Rate limiting**: Respects GoatCounter's 4 requests/second limit

## Rate Limiting

GoatCounter has a rate limit of 4 requests per second. The client respects this limit and includes appropriate error handling for rate limit exceeded scenarios.

## Testing

The analytics system includes comprehensive tests:

```bash
npm test -- analytics.test.ts
```

Tests cover:

- API client functionality
- Error handling
- Data transformation
- Rate limiting behavior

## Monitoring

Monitor analytics health through:

- **Application logs**: Check for API errors
- **GoatCounter dashboard**: Verify data is being received
- **API response times**: Monitor for performance issues

## Privacy Compliance

GoatCounter is designed with privacy in mind:

- **No cookies** by default
- **No personal data** collection
- **GDPR compliant** out of the box
- **Data retention** policies configurable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"GoatCounter site code or API token not configured"**

   - Ensure both `goatcounter_site_code` and `goatcounter_api_token` are set for the project
   - Both fields are required for analytics to work

2. **"Failed to fetch analytics data"**

   - Check that the API token is valid and has the correct permissions
   - Verify the site code matches your GoatCounter site exactly
   - Check GoatCounter service status

3. **Rate limit errors**

   - The system automatically handles rate limiting (4 requests per second)
   - If you see rate limit errors, they should resolve automatically

4. **"No data returned"**

   - Verify the date range has data
   - Check if the site has received any pageviews
   - Ensure tracking script is properly installed on your website
   - Confirm the site code in the tracking script matches the project configuration

5. **Analytics not appearing in dashboard**
   - Verify both site code and API token are correctly configured
   - Check that the GoatCounter site is receiving data
   - Ensure the API token has read permissions

### Security Notes

- **API tokens are stored securely** in the database
- **Each project uses its own token** for better security isolation
- **Tokens are never exposed** in frontend code or logs
- **Use different tokens** for different projects when possible
