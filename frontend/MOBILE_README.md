# 📱 Nexus Mobile App Development Guide

Your React web app has been successfully converted to iOS and Android apps using Capacitor! Here's everything you need to know.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Test in Browser First

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to test your app with mobile-optimized styles.

### 2. Build Mobile Apps

```bash
npm run mobile:build
```

This builds your React app and syncs it with both iOS and Android.

### 3. Open in Native IDEs

```bash
# For Android
npm run mobile:android

# For iOS (requires Xcode)
npm run mobile:ios
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

### For Android Development:

1. **Install Android Studio**: Download from https://developer.android.com/studio
2. **Install Java JDK 17+**: Required for Android development
3. **Set up Android SDK**: Through Android Studio
4. **Create AVD (Android Virtual Device)**: For testing in emulator

### For iOS Development (Mac only):

1. **Install Xcode**: From Mac App Store
2. **Install CocoaPods**: `sudo gem install cocoapods`
3. **iOS Simulator**: Included with Xcode

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Daily Development:

1. Make changes to your React app
2. Test in browser: `npm run dev`
3. Build and sync: `npm run mobile:build`
4. Test on device/emulator

### Quick Commands:

```bash
# Build and open Android Studio
npm run mobile:android

# Build and open Xcode
npm run mobile:ios

# Run on Android emulator (if set up)
npm run mobile:serve

# Run on iOS simulator (if set up)
npm run mobile:serve:ios
```

```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Android SDK not found"**

   - Install Android Studio
   - Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable

2. **"CocoaPods not installed"**

   - Run: `sudo gem install cocoapods`

3. **"Xcode not found"**

   - Install Xcode from App Store
   - Run: `sudo xcode-select --install`

4. **App not updating**
   - Run: `npm run mobile:build` to sync changes

### Testing Without Native IDEs:

- Use browser dev tools mobile view
- Test responsive design at different screen sizes
- Use Chrome DevTools device simulation

## 🚀 Deployment

### Android (Google Play):

1. Build signed APK in Android Studio
2. Upload to Google Play Console
3. Follow Google Play guidelines

### iOS (App Store):

1. Archive and upload via Xcode
2. Submit through App Store Connect
3. Follow Apple's review guidelines
